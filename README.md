University MATLAB Projects



Any relevent university projects are posted and labelled here. All the files are written in MATLAB. Most of the code in here are functions created in MATLAB to be used in the ExtendedAPDCoursework.m file that I have been building in my Aircraft Performance and Design unit during my Second Year. Files will be added as they are created as this is currently an ongoing project. The aircraft in question is an Airbus A330-300.
